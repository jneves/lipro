Abstract
--------

Lipro (libre prototyping) is a free and and open source constructing toy for
hardware prototyping. It has several advantages over the existing alternatives
(Technic Lego, Tetrix, Makeblock, etc.):

1. It is free and always will be!
2. It is open source!
3. It is paramteric, therefore adoptable and scalable!
4. It is printable (all parts are support free)
5. All the external bits are widely available in any hardware store

Assemble parts
--------------

All parts can be assembked with a single screwdriver. The current statically
sized models require M3x10 and M3x16 screws, and their M3 nut counterparts. Here
is the quick assembly of a joint from scratch:

Example build
-------------

This is the first version, of a 2D plotter machine, to demonstrate the
capabilities of lipro's rapid prototyping. Since the project is in very early
stage, 3 components were designed to support this machine specifically, and are
not completely compatible with all the other parts of lipro. (The middle block,
the pen holder and the motor mount.)
